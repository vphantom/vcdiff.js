About this fork:
I needed this module as the basis for my https://github.com/vphantom/rarch
packing module and the package.json was broken.  I'm keeping this fork alive
until the original author possibly comes back to GitHub and merges (doesn't
seem likely).

About
Implementation of VCDiff (RFC 3284) in Javascript. Can be run on client or 
server. Current implementation was ported to javascript from 
http://code.google.com/p/diffable/ project.
According to RFC 3284: "The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression 
Data Format." Javascript implementation uses regular Array for deltas.

Usage.
Say we have two strings:
	"abcdef"
	"defghiabc"
and we want to calculate diff between them. Code will be as follows:

    var vcd = new diffable.Vcdiff(), delta;
    vcd.blockSize = 3; //setting blockSize to 3 (defaults to 20)
    delta = vcd.encode('abcdef', 'defghiabc');
    console.log(delta); // [3, 3, 'ghi', 0, 3]

//if we want to decode data from original string and delta:

    console.log(vcd.decode('abcdef', delta)); //'defghiabc'
